## Functionalities

- [x] Detect Duplicate Images

<br>


## Workleft

- [ ] Pipeline to draw live Graphs
- [ ] GUI to Play with Graphs Dynamically
- [ ] Remove Rendundant code (Eariler we worked on similarity but later moved to plain matching for clear results)
- [ ] Pipeline the data used for Generating Graphs as an easily intergratable Script

#### Note:
```txt
Delay in Publishing pip package because some more changes are needed in the style of running the script using multiprocessing,
It's of no use to simple publish a package that's hard to use with imports.
You can have fun with cli script, Relax and Enjoy Quarntine
```
